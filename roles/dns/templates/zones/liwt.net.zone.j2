; WARNING:

; The DNS CNAME ("canonical name") record exists to provide the canonical
; name associated with an alias name.  There may be only one such canonical
; name for any one alias.  That name should generally be a name that exists
; elsewhere in the DNS, though there are some rare applications for aliases
; with the accompanying canonical name undefined in the DNS.  An alias name
; (label of a CNAME record) may, if DNSSEC is in use, have SIG, NXT, and
; KEY RRs, but may have no other data.
