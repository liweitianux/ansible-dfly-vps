# The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) was created to speed up
# the process that operating systems and browsers use to check for
# certificate revocation.
# Allow the server to send its cached OCSP record to the client during
# the TLS handshake, bypassing the OCSP responder and saving a roundtrip
# between the client and the OCSP responder.
#
# NOTE: If the "ssl_certificate" file does NOT contain intermediate
#       certificates, the certificate of the server certificate issuer
#       should be present in the "ssl_trusted_certificate" file.
