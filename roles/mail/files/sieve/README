This directory contains the global Sieve scripts:

* before.d : scripts executed before the user's personal script;
* after.d : scripts executed after the user's personal script.

Most scripts are placed to the "after.d" location, thus enable user to
easily overwrite the system/global defaults.

NOTE:
* These Sieve scripts should have the proper ".sieve" extension.
* These Sieve scripts should been manually compiled, due to the lack of
  write permission for the caller process:
  $ sievec before.d
  $ sievec after.d
* Or change the directory's ownership to be "vmail:vmail".
